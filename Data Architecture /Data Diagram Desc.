The Citibike data architecture starts with the Data Source which is a CSV file with Citibike July ridership details. This then flows into Temporary Storage for initial cleaning and transformation. Here data is processed. Processed data is then stored in the Data Mart, providing a structured and centralized repository. Finally, data is accessed for Visualization, where key insights such as peak usage and user trends, are displayed in a clear format.
